    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pesto pasta salad is a vibrant and flavorful dish that's perfect for any occasion. It starts with tender, al dente pasta—often fusilli, rotini, or penne—that’s tossed with a zesty, aromatic pesto sauce made from fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. The result is a creamy, herbaceous coating that clings to each pasta shape. 

        To enhance the dish, you can add a variety of ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, black olives, or diced bell peppers for extra color and flavor. A sprinkle of toasted pine nuts or additional Parmesan cheese on top adds a delightful crunch and richness. For a touch of freshness, a handful of baby spinach or arugula can be folded in just before serving. 
        
        This pasta salad is a perfect blend of savory, tangy, and fresh flavors, making it a great side dish or a light main course. It’s also versatile and can be served chilled or at room temperature, making it an ideal choice for picnics, potlucks, or casual gatherings.

        <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil</li>

        <h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
